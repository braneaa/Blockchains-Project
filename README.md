# Blockchains Project

Here are the tools we've used to build the program:
1. Web3 JS - enables client side app to talk to blockchain
2. Metamask - enables browser to talk to blockchain
3. Ganache - local development blockchain
4. Remix - smart contract IDE

# What did we do?

Our team decided to create a contract that will check if a given barcode is real or not, which will tell us if the product we check is counterfeit or not.

# Why did we do this?

Well, we wanted to build something that would help anyone reduce the risk of buying a counterfeit item, be it a small store buying produce or a simple person going to the store to buy something.

The advantage of being on the blockchain means that it's almost impossible to add fake codes to the list of the real ones, meaning that an application like this is very secure (and also will make scammers think twice before scamming people).
